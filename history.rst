Founding
========

Py-CU was founded in February 2013 by a small group of individuals who sought a community of programmers and technology enthusiasts locally. Since then, Py-CU has quickly grown past the expectations set for it in February. It acts as a subgroup currently of Makerspace Urbana and heads events and activities in both Makerspace's and Py-CU's name.

Past Programs
=============

At this point, Py-CU has held regular biweekly general meetings, at first at Champaign Public Library and then Applied Research Associates, and weekly Hack Nights at Makerspace Urbana. During September and October 2013, Py-CU held its first series of tutorials for teaching programming to beginners with Python.
